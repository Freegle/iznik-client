<h1 class="text-center largest js-pagetitle">Why Freegle?</h1>
<h3 class="text-center">Because it saves money, time and the planet - and it's free.</h3>
<p>What, you need more reasons?  Ok!</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It's easy and convenient when giving - someone will come and take your stuff away, and you don't have to
        pay the council.
    </li>
    <li>
        You're helping out someone nearby - either giving them something they need, or giving them the gift of
        free space.
    </li>
    <li>
        It's good for the environment - it saves resources, and sometimes people will upcycle things to give them a whole
        new life.  And it might reduce your council's costs a bit.
    </li>
    <li>
        It's fun!  You meet lovely people, and each time you freegle you make the world just that little bit better.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Surely nobody would want this?</h2>
<p>You might not want something - but someone else might.  How would you find out?  Offer it up on Freegle!</p>
<h2>Surely nobody would give away this?</h2>
<p>Same thing - you might not, but someone else might.  Have a look.</p>
<h2>What about Freecycle?</h2>
<p>You can use both - but we think you'll enjoy freegling more.</p>
<h2>What about Gumtree?</h2>
<h2>Why not eBay it?</h2>
<p>
    You could - and if you need the money, go for it.  But it's quite a hassle to do that, and then you
    have to post it off.  Plus people are quite picky about what they're paying for.
</p>
<h2>What about trash nothing?</h2>
<p>Most Freegle communities are on trash nothing - so you can use them from there if you like.</p>
<h2>What about charity shops?</h2>
<p>Charity shops are great - they help charities raise funds they need.  But you don't always know what will
    sell and what won't, and there are some things they won't take.</p>
