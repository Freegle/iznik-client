<h2>About Freegle: What Do We Do?</h2>
<p>Do your unwanted but useful items need new homes?  Are you looking for something?</p>
<p>
    We help people give and get things for free in their local community.  Some people have stuff they don't want
    any more.  Other people would like things they don't have.  We match them up.  We don't have physical premises,
    or warehouses - people give things directly to each other.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Don't throw it away, give it away!</em>
</p>
<h2>How to get the best out of Freegle</h2>
<p>It's simple.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Post a message offering an item.</li>
    <li>Other people see it and reply to you</li>
    <li>Choose who to give it to and they collect.</li>
    <li>You've decluttered,  made someone's day and saved an item from landfill.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's freegling! And it's all free.</p>
<p>You can also search or browse the items offered, or post a request for something that other people might have</p>
