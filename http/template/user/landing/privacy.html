    We wonâ€™t pass on your email address to anyone else, and other freeglers can't see it.
</p>
<p>
    Other freeglers can see your name.  If you don't want that, you can change it in <a href="/settings">Settings</a>.

<p>
    We try to protect you from spammers and fraudsters.  Sometimes our volunteers may read what you write to check
    that it's not spam, phishing or other fraud.
</p>
<p>
    If you put phone numbers, email addresses or postal addresses into your posts on Freegle, other people will
    be able to see them.  If you're concerned about this, don't do it!
</p>
<p>
    So that potential new users can see what is being offering on Freegle, we make some details of posts public,
    i.e. the item name, approximate location, the description and any photos. No personal details are made public -
    unless in this information.
