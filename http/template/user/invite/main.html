<p>Wouldn't the world be better if more people freegled more often?  You can help!</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tell people! It's easy to forget that lots of people still haven't heard of us.</li>
  <li>Put up a poster.</li>
  <li>Invite your friends by email.</li>
</ul>
<p>You wouldn't be freegling unless someone had told you about it - can you pay it forward?</p>
<h3>Put up a poster</h3>
<p>
  This is an A4 poster with tear-off strips - good for noticeboards
  in cafes, community venues, or at work.

  You can help even more by letting us know where you put up posters.  Once we know where it is, then we can encourage
  other freeglers to put one up there in future.  <b>Please do this!</b>
