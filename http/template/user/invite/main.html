<p>Wouldn't the world be better if more people freegled more often?  You can help!</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tell people! It's easy to forget that lots of people still haven't heard of us.</li>
  <li>Put up a poster.</li>
  <li>Invite your friends by email.</li>
</ul>
<p>You wouldn't be freegling unless someone had told you about it - can you pay it forward?</p>
<h3>Put up a poster</h3>
<p>
  This is an A4 poster with tear-off strips - good for noticeboards
  in cafes, community venues, or at work.
