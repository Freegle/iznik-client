            <h3>eBay Favourite Charity Votes</h3>
            <p>Freegle could win up to <b>&pound;7000</b> from eBay if you (and your friends!) vote for us during October!</p>
            <p>This would be a big chunk of what it takes to keep Freegle running each year.</p>

            <h4>Votes so far</h4>
            <p>This graph shows the votes we've obtained since 1st October; Freegle is in dark green, our main rival is in red.  You can see eBay's leaderboard <a href="http://ebayforcharity.org.uk/favourites/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-realurl="true">here</a> - it's not updated as often.  It's eBay's numbers that will decide - ours are estimates.</p>
