          Each Freegle community is run by volunteers and they are there to help you and the members of that
          community get the best out of Freegle.  Keeping in touch with them can really help build a good
          relationship and ultimately benefit your council.
        </p>
        <p>Your local volunteer can post events and messages
          on behalf of your council, help with your waste reduction campaigns and they may even be able to
          attend any events you may be running.
