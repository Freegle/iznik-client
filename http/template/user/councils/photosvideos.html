          Looking for some images of items being Freegled?  We have permission to use these fantastic photographs
          which were published in the first issue of National Geographic 'Green' December 2009 to illustrate Sarah
          Lonsdale's article on recycling initiatives.  Pictured are Freegle members in Hackney and Waltham Forest.
          If you would like to use these, please ensure that they are referenced.

        <p>
          You may also be able to find willing local Freegle members who would be happy to feature in photographs
          for your own campaign.
