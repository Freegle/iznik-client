          Business cards are a simple and inexpensive way for your council to promote Freegle and are a good
          alternative when a poster may not be appropriate.  Business cards can be handed out at your events,
          left at council owned or managed buildings for distribution or sent out with mailshots.

          design for your council, just email <a data-realurl="true" href="mailto:media@ilovefreegle.org">media@ilovefreegle.org</a>.
