    <h1>Facebook "Buy and Sell" Groups</h1>
    <p>Groups can be linked to "buy and sell"/"swap"/"freebies" groups on Facebook.  This helps reach exactly the kind
        of people who would be interested in freegling, but they still have to join your group to reply.
        Some of your groups aren't.</p>
    <p>Please link them in <em>Settings->Group Settings</em> for these groups:</p>
