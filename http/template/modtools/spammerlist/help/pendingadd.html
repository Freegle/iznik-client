    <p>These are members who have reported as spammers by a moderator.  These reports will be reviewed to decide whether to add them to the spammer list.</p>
    <p>Please remember that people may not be spammers even if they are reported.  For example:</p>
    <b>
        <ul>
            <li>Members may join many groups because they are over-enthusiastic or have relatives in different places.</li>
            <li>Mail can be spoofed or accounts can be hacked - so a member can appear to send spam but not be a spammer.</li>
        </ul>
    </b>
    <p>For someone to be added to the list they need to have clear intent to deliberately spam/scam, or be a massive multijoiner.</p>
