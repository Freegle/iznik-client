        <p>Because of problems with Yahoo, messages may be automatically approved after 48 hours.
            If you don't want this to happen, please hold the message.</p>
    </div>
    <p>If you're using the new ModTools for the first time, and seeing lots of old pending messages,
        you need to go to a machine with the plugin installed (a desktop or laptop) for it to catch up.   You can
        install the plugin by clicking on the Chrome or Firefox icons on the bottom left, and you can watch it
        sync up in the Background Work column on the right.</p>
    <p>For groups on Yahoo, ModTools gets these from the APPROVE mails sent to the moderator that's added to your group, but
        they are also automatically synchronised via the plugin (if installed) when you load this page.</p>
    <p>If you don't want a group to go towards the counts and appear here in All My Groups, you can change that on the Settings page.</p>
