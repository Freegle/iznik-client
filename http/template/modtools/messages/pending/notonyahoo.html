                <p>This message can't be edited, because it's not on Yahoo.</p>
                <p>This can happen in several ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Usually, this is because a message has been posted but Yahoo hasn't processed it yet.</li>
                    <li>Sometimes, it's because Yahoo has just lost the message.</li>
                    <li>Sometimes, this is because someone else has deleted the message on Yahoo.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Please try again later - usually this will work in a few minutes.  If it doesn't, then check on
                    Yahoo to see if the message is in Pending there.  If it doesn't show up in a few hours, then
                    Yahoo has probably lost it, and you won't be able to edit this message - you'll need to approve
                    or reject it.</p>
