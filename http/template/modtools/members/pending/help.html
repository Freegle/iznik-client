    <p>For groups on Yahoo, ModTools gets these from the APPROVE mails sent to the moderator that's added to your group, but
        they are also automatically synchronised via the plugin (if installed) when you load this page.</p>
    <p>If you don't want a group to go towards the counts and appear here in All My Groups, you can change that on the Settings page.</p>
