                    You can use this to request that someone is whitelisted.</p>
                <p>
                    For example, if you have a member who
                    is enthusiastic and joins many groups, then they might show up as a possible spammer - this way
                    people will know that they aren't.
                </p>
                <p>Similarly, volunteers who might need to join many groups are often whitelisted.</p>
                <p>This reason will be visible to other moderators, so please make sure it's helpful.</p>
