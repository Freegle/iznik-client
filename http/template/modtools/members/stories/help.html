        (Freegle Only) When members have had a few successful posts, we email them and ask them for their story.  They
        can say whether we can share it in public or not.

        You will see stories here from members on groups which you mod.  Sometimes the story might not be specifically
        about your group - if that happens leave it for that group to see.
