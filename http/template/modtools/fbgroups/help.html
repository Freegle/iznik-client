    <p>(Freegle only)This page lets you promote your Freegle group by sharing out posts to Facebook "buy and sell" groups.</p>
    <p>When members post on Freegle, they agree to this:</p>
    <code>
        We may show this post, but not your email address, to people who are not members of the group.
        This helps the group grow by showing people what's happening and encouraging them to join.
    </code>
    <p>Facebook users still have to join your group to reply.</p>
    <p>First search for the Facebook group you want to share to. You must be a member of the Facebook group.<p>
    <p>Then select some posts and click to share.</p>
