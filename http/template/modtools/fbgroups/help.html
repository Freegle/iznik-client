        (Freegle only) You can link one or more Facebook "buy and sell" groups to your Freegle group.  This helps more people find out about Freegle.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>OFFERs/WANTEDs from the Freegle group which have been posted from Freegle Direct will be posted
        onto the Facebook group.</li>
        <li>People have to sign up to Freegle and will join your group if they reply.</li>
        <li>We can't post messages from other sources - we don't have permissions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You don't have to be a Page Admin on the Facebook group, you can just be a normal member.  The
        group has to be a 'Public' rather than 'Closed' group (just because that's what Facebook lets us
        do).  You want to choose busy groups, because then we are reaching new people.
